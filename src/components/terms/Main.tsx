            You acknowledge that a virtual consultation may not be the
            appropriate course of treatment for your particular healthcare
            needs. Medical services rendered by a Provider are subject to their
            professional judgment. Any information or advice received from a
            Provider comes from the individual Provider. You and your individual
            Provider are solely responsible for all information and/or
            communication sent during a virtual consultation or other Clinical
            Services communication. Virtual consultations with Providers are not
            intended to replace your relationship with your existing primary
            care physician and are not a substitute for regular use of your
            primary care physician if you need to. Virtual consultations cannot
            be used for any service that must be provided to you by your regular
            physician as an in-office follow up to an in-office visit, at no
            additional charge to you or your health care plan, as required by
            your health care plan.

            age to form a binding contract. If you are not of legal age to form
            a binding contract, you may not register to use our Services. You

            Any clinical information provided as part of a virtual consultation
            becomes part of your legal medical record. Virtual consultations are
            provided in real-time. Accordingly, no audio or video recordings are
            maintained or stored in your legal medical record. You agree to
            provide accurate information about yourself for your legal medical
            record. Use of your legal medical record by your Provider is
            governed by our Notice of Privacy Practices. It is your
            responsibility to confirm any third party information, or
            information regarding a minor child of whom you are a parent or
            legal guardian, in your medical record. Any prescriptions ordered by
            Providers are subject to state regulations and prescriptions may not
            be available in your country or region. In the event that a Provider
            does prescribe a medication, he/she will limit the supply based on
            state regulations and will only prescribe a medication, as
            determined appropriate in his/her sole discretion and professional
            judgment. There is no guarantee that a prescription will be written.
            Any prescriptions that you acquire from a Provider shall be solely
            for your personal use. You should fully and carefully read all
            provided product information and labels and contact a physician or
            pharmacist if you have any questions regarding any prescription that
            you acquire from a Provider.

            discretion without notice. We will not be liable if for any reason
            all or any part of the App is unavailable at any time or for any
            period. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of
            the App, or the entire App. We reserve the right to suspend,
            discontinue or deny your access to and use of the App for any lawful
            reason.

          <p>
            You are responsible for making all arrangements necessary for you to
            have access to the App. We offer remote services using the internet,
            data networks, and devices which can access the internet and which
            can operate the App and our website (“Infrastructure”). We make the
            App and our website available for access using Infrastructure, but
            are not responsible for Infrastructure ourselves. The App operates
            only on Android-enabled phones running Android v5.0 or higher or
            iPhone version 5S or higher running IOS 11 or higher. StableDoc
            reserves the right to update the IOS and Android versions supported,
            and to discontinue supporting older versions of IOS or Android, at
            any time. The StableDoc Mobile App requires a consistent 4G or
            faster data connection and does not operate reliably on 3G, GPRS or
            EDGE connections. If you wish to use the App, you should ensure you
            have an internet-enabled device and a sufficient internet connection
            available. You acknowledge that technical or security threats or
            issues affecting the Infrastructure may require us to suspend our
            services in order to ensure they are secure and/or operating
            optimally.

          <p>
            You are responsible for ensuring the security of the device you use
            to access the App. We strongly recommend that if you are using a
            wireless network to access the App, you avoid use of public wi-fi
            facilities in favor of a personal wi-fi connection, and that the
            wireless network is secured with at least WPA-2 security. We
            recommend that the device from which you access the App is password
            protected, set to lock after a short period of inactivity, and
            protected with suitable security features.

            You understand that the risk that ePHI contained in an email will be
            read by a third party, other than the intended recipient, cannot be
            eliminated. Reasonable measures will be used to protect the security
            and confidentiality of ePHI sent and received, including the use of
            encryption and other security technologies to the extent available.
            However, because of the risks outlined above, it is not possible to
            guarantee the security and confidentiality of email or push
            notifications. You understand that if you opt to send or receive
            ePHI via email or push notifications, we are not responsible for any
            unauthorized access to your health information that occurs during
            transmission. Moreover, we bear no responsibility for safeguarding
            the ePHI once it is transmitted to you.

            From time to time, updates to the App may be made available to you.
            We recommend that you use the latest version of the App at all
            times, to take advantage of the latest enhancements and important
            updates. Depending on the update, you may not be able to use the App

            To access the App or some of the resources it offers, you may be
            asked to provide certain registration details or other information.
            It is a condition of your use of the App that all the information
            you provide on the App is correct, current, and complete. We may
            contact you by telephone, mail or email to verify your StableDoc
            account information. We may request further information from you and

            must treat such information as confidential, and you must not
            disclose it to any other person or entity. You also acknowledge that
            your account is personal to you and agree not to provide any other
            person with access to this App or portions of it using your user
            name, password, or other security information. You agree to notify
            us promptly of any unauthorized access to or use of your user name
            or password or any other breach of security. You also agree to
            ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session.
            You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a
            public or shared device so that others are not able to view or
            record your password or other personal information.
