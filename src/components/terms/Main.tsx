            You acknowledge that a virtual consultation may not be the
            appropriate course of treatment for your particular healthcare
            needs. Medical services rendered by a Provider are subject to their
            professional judgment. Any information or advice received from a
            Provider comes from the individual Provider. You and your individual
            Provider are solely responsible for all information and/or
            communication sent during a virtual consultation or other Clinical
            Services communication. Virtual consultations with Providers are not
            intended to replace your relationship with your existing primary
            care physician and are not a substitute for regular use of your
            primary care physician if you need to. Virtual consultations cannot
            be used for any service that must be provided to you by your regular
            physician as an in-office follow up to an in-office visit, at no
            additional charge to you or your health care plan, as required by
            your health care plan.

            Any clinical information provided as part of a virtual consultation
            becomes part of your legal medical record. Virtual consultations are
            provided in real-time. Accordingly, no audio or video recordings are
            maintained or stored in your legal medical record. You agree to
            provide accurate information about yourself for your legal medical
            record. Use of your legal medical record by your Provider is
            governed by our Notice of Privacy Practices. It is your
            responsibility to confirm any third party information, or
            information regarding a minor child of whom you are a parent or
            legal guardian, in your medical record. Any prescriptions ordered by
            Providers are subject to state regulations and prescriptions may not
            be available in your country or region. In the event that a Provider
            does prescribe a medication, he/she will limit the supply based on
            state regulations and will only prescribe a medication, as
            determined appropriate in his/her sole discretion and professional
            judgment. There is no guarantee that a prescription will be written.
            Any prescriptions that you acquire from a Provider shall be solely
            for your personal use. You should fully and carefully read all
            provided product information and labels and contact a physician or
            pharmacist if you have any questions regarding any prescription that
            you acquire from a Provider.
